# MU Trivia Competition
This project is a customizable trivia competition platform built for a live university event between the Computer Science and Business clubs. It was designed to support a unique visual identity per event, allowing organizers to modify backgrounds, styles, and questions without changing the application code.

The application is built with Flutter and uses Supabase as the backend for data storage and retrieval. Efficient data structures are used to manage questions, scoring, and game flow, ensuring smooth performance during live competitions. The system was continuously tested throughout development to identify and fix bugs, with a focus on reliability and stability in a real-world event setting.
